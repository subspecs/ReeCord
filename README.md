# ReeCord



'ReeCord' is a custom designed social platform, similar to the well known "Discord", but with less wokeness.



It will be self-contained and self-hostable.


Currently it's 4am for me and I am tired of writing.


The server will be available also under open-source when the client is ready for the beta stage.

Until then, you can support me at https://www.patreon.com/subspecs, which will grant you access to public tests and the 'ReeCord' public server.
